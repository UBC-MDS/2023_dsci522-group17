    "If someone violates the Code of Conduct during a Group 17 event or in an online space outside of organised events, we ask that you ask the person to stop. If they do not stop the inappropriate behavior immediately, raise the issue with the team and the behavior will be addressed by the rest of the team members. If you do not feel the behavior has been adequately addressed, or it has still not stopped, report it to the Instructor(s). The current instructor(s) of DSCI 522 is(are) Tiffany Timbers. An email message to the email address listed in the course syllabus will be seen by the instructor. To report a DSCI 522 Group 17 code of conduct violation that will not be seen by your instructor, an alternative contact person is Milad Maymay, Director, Program Operations and Student Management, MDS Vancouver. His email is maymay@science.ubc.ca."
