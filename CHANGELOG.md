## Log of improvements made based on milestone and peer review feedback

#### Improvements made based on Milestone 1 feedback
- "You should state the classes for "potential". It is not an obvious classification problem (potential could also be a numeric rating) so you should state this in the introduction."
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/pull/37/commits/6ca19434b5c9496ce2c04350500680e3091d04e5
Stated the target classes we created by binning the target variable 'potential'.

- "Findings from project are not linked back to the application domain." 
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/pull/37/commits/6ca19434b5c9496ce2c04350500680e3091d04e5
In the discussion section, linked the findings back to the application domain.

- "The analysis notebook (.ipynb or .Qmd or *Rmd) should be in a sub-directory called something sensible, such as analysis, src, notebooks, docs, etc, to aid in the discoverability of this file, and related ones. Having too many files in the project root makes the project organization less understandable and can lead to longer activation times to productivity for collaborators (including future you!)." 
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/commit/ee4f57ccc435662b4eca776baa8391c232fe75c4
This commit is where the src sub-directory was created. Other scripts were added to it subsequently.

- Re: Contributing file - "The file exists, but is not detailed enough. Please refer to the example provided in the Milestone 1 requirement's description"
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/commit/7416a75ace9de51486ed870afb5b6c34cfdae00c
Improved the contributing file based on the breast cancer predictor template.

- "versions are missing from environment.yml for all R and Python packages"
"in the repository, you have a file with a .yaml extension, while in the README file you provide a code to create an environment from the file that has a .yml extension. Additional 0.5 deduction. Please be accurate and consistent, it also affected reproducibility"
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/commit/50b4ef858e265b901606a6e24f9cf92a26a57563
Versions were added to the environment file

- Re: License file - "You are expected to have the CC license text in the license file"
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/commit/a12154280d2e49ce79e94f88b463d19dd16c846c
Updated the license file based on breast cancer predictor template

- Re: EDA plots - "There is no legend (at least in the PDF) for the colours in the density plots).
There are no figure legends or table descriptions"
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/commit/f7f481f01c90cd35c6edff0ebca34225ea209bff
The plots already had a legend but it was being cut off in the PDF, so changed the size of the plots so the legend wouldn't get cut off.

- Re: use of git issues for communication: "2 issues are not enough for Milestone 1"
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/issues?q=is%3Aissue
Issues have been used consistently since milestone 1. With many issues being many comments long.

https://github.com/UBC-MDS/fifa-potential/issues?q=is%3Aissue
