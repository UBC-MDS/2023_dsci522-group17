### Summary


### Introduction

One of the most challenging jobs for sports coaches is deciding which players will make a positive addition to the team (US National Soccer Players, 2023). A key step in evaluating which players to add to a team is predicting how their skill level will change over time. We can think of this in terms of their potential. FIFA22 by EA sports is the world's leading soccer video game. For each year's release, they rate players' skill levels in various aspects of the game such as shooting, passing, defending, etc. and give each player an overall rating as well as a rating of each player's potential. 

Here we ask if we can use a machine learning model to classify players by their potential using their skill attribute ratings,  with target categories "Low", "Medium", "Good", and "Great". The categories are split on the quartiles of the FIFA22 potential ratings distribution.
